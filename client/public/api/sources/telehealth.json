  "content": "The Veterans Health Administration (VA), America's largest public healthcare provider, proactively expanded telehealth services across its hospitals and clinics. VA leaders established clear, long-term goals, investing heavily in infrastructure, technology training, and digital literacy programs for veterans and clinicians. During the COVID-19 pandemic, telehealth usage surged, facilitating 3.8 million video consultations in 2020 alone—a 1,200% increase from 2019. By mid-2021, VA providers conducted over 6.7 million virtual visits. Telehealth markedly improved healthcare access for rural and disabled veterans, cutting travel time by an average of 142 minutes per visit. VA’s proactive policy advocacy overcame regulatory barriers to interstate care delivery. Additionally, the remote monitoring program saved approximately $6,500 per patient annually, totaling about $1 billion in annual savings. Despite early resistance from staff and patients, consistent training, direct support, and strong leadership advocacy facilitated widespread adoption and continued innovation."
