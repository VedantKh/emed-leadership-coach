    "content": "Leicester NHS hospitals faced increased skin cancer referrals and shortages of dermatology specialists post-pandemic. In response, leadership collaborated with primary care and cancer teams, integrating AI-based teledermatology. AI analyzed patient-uploaded photos of skin lesions, allowing rapid triage and clinical oversight. Initially, clinicians were skeptical about AI reliability, but leaders mitigated these concerns by ensuring dermatologists directly reviewed AI outputs. Staff training and cross-team collaboration were emphasized to build trust. Within six months, over a third of referrals (799 of 2,023 patients) were safely managed without hospital visits, dramatically improving patient convenience and speeding up diagnosis timelines. Challenges like funding for scaling and clinical adoption were addressed through documented pilot success and rigorous validation, showcasing how leadership and AI technology combined can optimize patient care effectively."
